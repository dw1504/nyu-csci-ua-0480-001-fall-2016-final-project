<h1>Donate and Foster</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

  We live in a world where environmental issues have become essential to everyday life. Recycling is a important tool to make a better way of living. 
  
  This is a web app where you can keep track of the water bottles you have donated. In returns, the number of water bottles will transfer into dog food, which will be used to help homeless dogs and keep hungry away from them.
